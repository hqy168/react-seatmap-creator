# React Seat Map Creator

Welcome to the **React Seat Map Creator** – an intuitive and powerful tool for managing seating arrangements at events, concerts, and venues! This application allows event organizers and administrators to design seating layouts with ease, featuring dynamic functionalities for adding, removing, and customizing rows and seats. Whether you're setting up for a concert, theater production, or conference, this tool simplifies the process of managing your venue's seating.

## Key Features

- **Intuitive Seat and Row Management**: Effortlessly manage your seating layout with a simple drag-and-drop interface. You can quickly add, remove, and modify both rows and seats in real-time to match your event's requirements.

- **Dynamic Row Creation**: Add new rows to your layout with a single click. Choose between adding **empty rows** for general seating or **seated rows** pre-populated with available seats, making it easy to configure your layout.

- **Flexible Seat Insertion**: Insert new seats next to existing ones with ease. Whether you want to add a seat to the **left** or **right** of a specific seat, this feature lets you seamlessly expand your seating arrangement on the fly.

- **Customizable Empty Seats**: Create **empty spaces** in your seating layout to represent gaps between seats. This feature allows for personalized row configurations, giving you full control over how your venue’s seating looks.

- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, ensuring that the seat management interface works seamlessly across both **desktop** and **mobile** devices. Whether you're using a large screen or a tablet, the interface remains clean, intuitive, and user-friendly.

- **Contextual Seat and Row Management**: Manage seats and rows with ease using contextual **right-click** dropdown menus. These menus provide quick access to seat operations like adding/removing seats, editing row names, and more, all from a single-click action.

- **Real-Time Data Update**: Any changes made to the seating layout are immediately reflected, ensuring that you always have an up-to-date view of your seating chart.

- **Drag-and-Drop Row Reordering**: Rearrange rows effortlessly using the drag-and-drop functionality. The rows can be moved up or down in the layout, providing flexibility in adjusting your seating arrangement in response to event changes.

- **Seamless Data Persistence**: Save your seating chart configurations easily for future use. Whether you’re working on a multi-day event or need to adjust seating for different shows, your seating layout is ready whenever you need it.

## How to Use

- **Create Rows**: Add new rows of seats by clicking the “Add Row” button, where you can specify if it's an empty or seated row.
- **Add Seats**: Click on the seat to add a new seat to either side, making it easier to expand your seating capacity dynamically.
- **Delete and Edit**: Right-click on any row or seat to access options for deletion or renaming, allowing for quick and easy management.

## Conclusion

The **React Seat Map Creator** is the perfect tool for administrators looking to efficiently design and manage seating layouts for their events. Whether you're dealing with a single-row venue or a complex seating chart, this app provides all the tools you need to create a seamless and flexible seating experience. Happy seat planning!

## Testing & Continuous Integration

Automated tests and a CI workflow were added to make maintenance easier. Key points:

- Tests are run with the existing CRA/Jest setup. A convenient npm script was added:

  npm test

  (This runs: `react-scripts test --watchAll=false`.)

- Local install note: the project currently uses React v19 while some test tooling expects React v18 as a peer dependency. If a plain `npm install` fails with a dependency tree error, run:

  npm install --legacy-peer-deps

  This is a pragmatic fallback used in CI as well. Consider aligning test-library / React versions in a future change to remove the fallback.

- Test helpers and mocks:
  - `src/setupTests.ts` registers test setup (imports `@testing-library/jest-dom` and centralizes manual mocks).
  - Manual Jest mocks live under `src/__mocks__/` (for example `react-hot-toast` and the seeded `data.json`).
  - Unit tests for the seat-map business logic are in `src/pages/__tests__/useCreatorPage.test.tsx`.

- CI: A GitHub Actions workflow was added at `.github/workflows/test.yml`. It attempts `npm ci` first, and falls back to `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` if needed, then runs `npm test`.

- Test philosophy: the added tests are isolated unit tests that mock external modules and avoid network or file-system dependencies. They exercise the `useCreatorPage` hook (the single source of seat-map business logic) and cover add/edit/delete/reorder behaviors.

If you'd like, I can:

- Add a lint/build job to CI as a separate workflow.
- Align testing libraries with React 19 (upgrade/downgrade) to remove the legacy-peer-deps fallback.
